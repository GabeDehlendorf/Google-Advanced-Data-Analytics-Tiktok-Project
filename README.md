# TikTok Claims Classification Project

## Overview
This project simulates the work of a data professional working at TikTok tasked with creating a machine learning algorithm that will sort tiktoks into claims of fact or opinions.
The company would like to streamline the process of content review since millions of tiktoks are reported monthly.
The project's labs and executive summaries took place at the end of every module in the course, integrating the newly learned data analysis techniques into the next sequential step of the whole project.

## Key Components

* `Deliverables`: The first deliverable is an outline of the project's order and the remaining deliverables are executive summaries of lab findings.
* `Labs`: Contains the python code used to conduct the data analysis and create the visualizations presented in deliverables 2-6.

## Data Sources

The data file 'Tiktok Data.csv' was provided by Google and, for each tiktok, contains many columns indicating tiktok properties and engagement levels: video_duration_sec, video_like_count, video_share_count, 


## How to Use

The deliverables show increasingly more advanced data analysis topics as the course continued on. The latter labs and deliverables apply concepts form the previous ones, with the latter labs providing the bulk of the project's work.
