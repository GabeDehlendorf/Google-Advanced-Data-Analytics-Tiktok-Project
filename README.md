This project simulates the work of a data professional working at TikTok tasked with creating a machine learning algorithm that will sort tiktoks into claims of fact or opinions. 
The company would like to streamline the process of content review since millions of tiktoks are reported monthly.
The project's labs and executive summaries took place at the end of every module in the course, integrating the newly learned data analysis techniques into the next sequential step of the whole process.
